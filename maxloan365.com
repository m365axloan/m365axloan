Carl Ruby knew his hometown of Springfield, Ohio, had plenty of problems, but one thing in particular caught his eye about three years ago. He counted five McDonald’s restaurants in the town of roughly 60,000 people—and 18 payday lending stores.

Ruby, the senior pastor of Springfield’s Central Christian Church, had heard troubling accounts of people turning to payday lenders when they couldn’t pay their monthly bills—and then struggling with exorbitant interest rates and recurring fees. He says he worried initially that payday lenders might take advantage of the many immigrants his church serves. But he soon learned that low-income people of all ethnicities and backgrounds use the loans. And the more he looked, the more alarmed he became.

“I was just shocked when I saw what the interest rates were,” Ruby says. “I thought it would be maybe 30 or 40 percent, and I thought that was bad. But then I saw rates were 500 percent, 600 percent.”
