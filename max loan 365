Pew noted that more than 3 in 4 payday borrowers in the U.S. “rely on lenders to provide accurate information about the product.” Lenders typically “describe loans as ‘safe,’ ‘a sensible financial choice,’ and ‘the best alternative to meet their current needs’ for a ‘one-time fixed fee,’” the report explained.

Pew found, however, that the average payday loan borrower in the U.S. had a loan out for five months of the year, not just the advertised two weeks. In Ohio, owing $300 for five months typically cost $680 in fees and interest alone. By contrast, in Colorado, which enacted reforms in 2010, the average cost of such a loan was $172.
