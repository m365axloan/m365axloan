The 12 million Americans who take out payday loans each year are usually workers whose incomes sometimes can’t stretch to the end of the month. Their credit history, if they have one, often disqualifies them for bank loans. But to qualify for a payday loan, they need only have a regular paycheck and a checking account. The borrower goes to a payday lender—often in a storefront with colorful neon signs—and obtains a small loan, which averages $375 nationally. The lender receives a postdated check from the borrower’s bank account, or permission to debit the account on the borrower’s next payday. In either case, this puts the lender first in line for payment before any of the borrower’s other debts or expenses. In many cases the loan is due to be repaid, with interest and fees, in about two weeks, although some loans carry longer terms.

But most borrowers find that sacrificing around one-third of their paycheck to repay the cash advance leaves them unable to cover their bills, so they renew the loan, usually repeatedly.

Millions of Americans can find themselves in such straits. The Federal Reserve says 40 percent of U.S. adults cannot handle an unexpected $400 expense without borrowing money or selling possessions.
